In 2020, I started my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and have since been diving deeper into the world of software development.\n\nWith a focus on Front-End, I've contributed to over 20 high-impact projects that are part of the daily lives of hundreds of users around the world.

    "presentation": "My name is Karol Wojtyla ‚Äì yes, just like Pope John Paul II. Despite the Polish name, I was born faaar from there, in a beautiful city in the interior of Par√°, Brazil, called Bragan√ßa ‚Äì the pearl of the Caet√©. I'm 22 years old, but my professional journey began way back, long before ChatGPT or Bobbie Goods. Come with me, I‚Äôll tell you all about it.\n\nI guess you could say I was a rather peculiar kid ‚Äì the unknown always fascinated me. That‚Äôs how I started making my first doodles in Paint, playing around with Photoshop, and even doing some curious modifications in ResourceTuner. In 2017, things took a more serious turn when I got accepted in first place into the technical course in Software Development at IFPA.\n\nHaving that kind of technical experience in high school made a huge difference. At IFPA, I was introduced to new worldviews, broader horizons, and, most importantly, to technology in the way I had always dreamed ‚Äì even if I didn‚Äôt fully realize it at the time. The love for programming that was born there led me to create my very first website (does it count if it was on Wix?), and it‚Äôs a passion I‚Äôve been nurturing ever since I started my degree in 2020.\n\nThat year, I began my Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Engineering at UFPA, right in the middle of the chaos of the pandemic. I‚Äôll admit ‚Äì it was a tough time, full of losses and the strange experience of a ‚Äúnew normal.‚Äù\n\nWhen in-person activities returned, I knew I didn‚Äôt want to slow down. I joined an internship at UFPA, later got hired by Oi, where I spent two great years, and today I help transform the experience of hundreds of investors at Seazone, where I work as a Software Engineering Intern.\n\nAnd well... since 2017, it‚Äôs been over 20 projects, with hundreds of monthly users. But more than the numbers, every line of code carries a piece of me ‚Äì from the curious boy in Bragan√ßa to the purposeful professional I‚Äôve become. And I keep moving forward, believing that when done with intention, technology can change lives. Starting with mine.",
